Description: Map image classificatino efficacy (MICE) is an alternative accuracy assessment metric introduced in the following studies:

Shao, G., Tang, L. and Zhang, H., 2021. Introducing image classification efficacies. IEEE Access, 9, pp.134809-134816.

Tang, L., Shao, J., Pang, S., Wang, Y., Maxwell, A., Hu, X., Gao, Z., Lan, T. and Shao, G., 2024. Bolstering Performance 
Evaluation of Image Segmentation Models with Efficacy Metrics in the Absence of a Gold Standard. IEEE Transactions on 
Geoscience and Remote Sensing.

MICE adjusts the accuracy rate relative to a random classification baseline. Only the proportions from the reference labels are considered, 
as opposed to the proportions from the reference and predictions, as is the case for the Kappa statistic. This package offers means to calculate
MICE and adjusted versions of class-level user's (i.e., precision) and producer's (i.e., recall) accuracies and F1-scores. Class-level metrics are
aggregated using macro-averaging. Functions are also made avaiable to estiamte confidence intervals using bootstrapping and statistically compare
two classification results.
